This project is owned by the Verification as a Service team.
To contribute to this project, you'll need to follow the [fork-and-PR](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) workflow.

* We try to follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for coding standards.
* Tests run as a side effect of PRs must not be broken

As this library is powering production services, new features must be approved by the team. Feel free to contribute PRs for bug fixes, but anything beyond that should
have at least have a discussion first. Please use the Github issue tracker to kick off the discussion. Rough ideas to fully fleshed out designs are welcome!

PRs can be submitted at any time, however if it's not ready to be merged, please add the "work in progress" label.


## Pull Request Process

1. You must create your own fork, and a feature branch on that fork.
2. Try not to introduce system wide breakages.
3. Your feature must not cause any failure of current tests. 
4. You need to show testing compliance for your added code.
5. Please write copious PR comments, so you remember what you did.
6. If appropriate, update the README.md with any relevant details of changes you made which affect the project. This may include changes to the interface, new environment variables, new ports, useful new file locations, added or removed dependencies, and anything else that will affect other contributors.
7. We will contact you when you create your PR. In some cases, we may just approve it for merge.
